## About

Based off of the the theme [hotstick.minimal](https://github.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh/blob/main/themes/hotstick.minimal.omp.json) found in the [main themes repository](https://github.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh/themes/). Hotstick basically only shows the pwd path inside of nice powerlevel9k arrow style block segments. *Seems like an easy theme to modify.*
